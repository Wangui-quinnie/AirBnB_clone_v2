What is a Web Framework?
A web framework is a software framework designed to aid the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. It provides a standardized way to build and deploy web applications, offering a set of tools, libraries, and conventions to streamline development tasks.

How to Build a Web Framework with Flask:
Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. To build a basic web framework with Flask, you need to follow these steps:

Install Flask:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask
Create a basic Flask application:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
Save the file as app.py and run it. You'll have a basic Flask web server running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

How to Define Routes in Flask:
In Flask, routes are defined using the @app.route() decorator. The argument to this decorator is the URL path that the route should respond to. For example:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'About Page'
What is a Route?
A route is a URL pattern that the application recognizes. When a user accesses a specific URL, the associated route function is executed, and a response is returned.

How to Handle Variables in a Route:
You can capture variables from the URL by defining them in the route pattern. For example:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def show_user_profile(username):
    return f'User {username}'
Here, <username> is a variable that will be passed to the show_user_profile function.

What is a Template?
A template is a file containing HTML and placeholders for dynamic content. In Flask, templates are typically written using the Jinja2 template engine.

How to Create an HTML Response in Flask by Using a Template:

Create a templates folder in your project directory.
Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) inside the templates folder:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Flask Template Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
</body>
</html>
Modify your Flask app to render the template:
python
Copy code
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', message='Hello, Flask!')
How to Create a Dynamic Template (Loops, Conditions):
Jinja2 templates support loops and conditions. For example:

html
Copy code
{% for item in items %}
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
{% endfor %}

{% if condition %}
    <p>This is true</p>
{% else %}
    <p>This is false</p>
{% endif %}
How to Display in HTML Data from a MySQL Database:

Install the Flask-MySQL extension:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask-MySQL
Configure the MySQL connection in your Flask app:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask
from flask_mysqldb import MySQL

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'username'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'password'
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'database_name'

mysql = MySQL(app)
Use the MySQL connection in your route:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/users')
def get_users():
    cur = mysql.connection.cursor()
    cur.execute('SELECT username FROM users')
    users = cur.fetchall()
    cur.close()
    return render_template('users.html', users=users)
Create a template (users.html) to display the data:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>User List</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>User List</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for user in users %}
            <li>{{ user[0] }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
This example assumes you have a MySQL database with a table named users containing a column named username. Adjust the database configuration and queries based on your specific setup.

7. Improve engines
Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine:

Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects
Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) tips or close() on the class Session tips
Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present

If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State

8. List of states
Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/states_list: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
IMPORTANT

Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
Make sure all tables are created when you run echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py

9. Cities by states
Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/cities_by_states: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B> + UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
IMPORTANT

Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
Make sure all tables are created when you run echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py

10. States and State

You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities

H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
/states/<id>: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
If a State object is found with this id:
H1 tag: “State: ”
H3 tag: “Cities:”
UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
